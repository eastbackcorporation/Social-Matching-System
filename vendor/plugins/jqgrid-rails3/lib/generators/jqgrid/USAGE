Example : 
 
$ ./script/generate jqgrid user id pseudo email firstname
 
will generate the controller and the index view with the grid.


Example with a master-detail view: 
 
$ ./script/generate jqgrid user id pseudo email firstname +account user_id balance credit_rating
 
will generate the controller and the index view with the grid and a detail grid.  The + indicates the start of the detail grid.  The first parameter is the model to use (account) and the user_id is to be used as the foreign key and the detail grid is to have two columns (balance and credit_rating).  Any number of detail grids can be supported.

Enjoy!
